## My process

- 1. check the difference between mobile and desktop to create the hmtl structure
- 2. upload fonts, identify colors and where they should be aplied
- 2. implemented the changes between desktop and mobile orientation of the flex boxes
- 3. styled each area

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box

### What I learned

- Practice more about flex box as the design requires distinct orientations for each part of the page
- It is always better to implement the flexibility of the containers before styling the content

### Continued development

Understand more about centralized the main element on the page. I used the same solution od other challenges but it was nor working and I could not understando why. I aligned using flexbox and changed the height on desktop version, works but I'm not happy with a lack of explanation why.
